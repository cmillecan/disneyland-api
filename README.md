# Disneyland App
Disneyland App is a full-stack web application that provides information on Disney attractions and park resources. This project primarily focuses on a back-end which stores the information and includes APIs which follow RESTful principles to expose end-points of each resource. It also has an accompanying front-end built with React to act as a client to the back-end.
